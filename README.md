# Clustering of water chemistry data from spring on the Kaibab Plateau (KP), north of the Grand Canyon, AZ


Respository consists of various representative clustering methods (kmeans+, gaussian, and hierarchal clustering) aimed at analyzing spring chemistry data on Kaibab Plateau north of Grand Canyon, AZ.  Purpose is to indentify springs that have similar chemistries and therefore possibly connected flow paths and similar origins.
